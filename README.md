BlueSkeye template docs
------------------------

This is a set of documentation that provides a full set of information on the Blueskeye React Native template, used to bootstrap Blueskeye apps. There are many choices that have to be made when building an app; most in relation to the particular libraries that will be used, and how they all fit together into something that is coherent and easy to understand and extend. This is living documentation; as we build more projects and learn more, we hope to capture all of our learning and to develop this into an increasingly valuable resource.  

These documents are kept separate from the template code itself, in order that we can keep this public and our internal code private.  The documentation is split into the following sections:

1. [Overview](/overview/index.md)
2. [State Management](/state/index.md)
3. [Navigation](/navigation/index.md)
4. [Network](/network/index.md)
5. [Testing](/testing/index.md)
6. [Style and themeing](/style/index.md)
6. [Logging and errors](/logging/index.md)
